<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Temperature Grease & Lubricants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soap Thickener</li><li>Non-Soap Thickener</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High temperature grease and lubricants are available in two main types: soap thickener and non-soap thickener. Soap thickener greases are made by incorporating a soap-like material as a thickener, such as lithium or calcium soap. Non-soap thickener greases, on the other hand, use complex chemicals like polyurea or bentonite to thicken the lubricants. Soap thickener greases are commonly used in general purpose applications, while non-soap thickener greases are preferred for high temperature and extreme pressure conditions.</p></p>
