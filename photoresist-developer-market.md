<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Developer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Type</li><li>Negative Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photoresist developer market is divided into two main types: Positive Type and Negative Type. Positive Type developers enhance the areas of the photoresist coating exposed to light, making them more soluble and easier to remove. Negative Type developers work by dissolving the unexposed areas of the photoresist coating, leaving behind the areas that were protected from light. Each type has its own advantages and applications in industries such as semiconductor manufacturing, printed circuit board production, and microelectronics.</p></p>
