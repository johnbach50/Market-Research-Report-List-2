<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Computer Cooling Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Computer cooling fans come in two main types: axial fans and centrifugal fans. Axial fans are designed to move air parallel to the fan's axis, providing a high airflow rate for general cooling purposes. Centrifugal fans, on the other hand, use a rotating impeller to increase the pressure of the air and direct it outward, making them more efficient for cooling confined spaces or systems with restricted airflow. Both types cater to different cooling needs in the computer industry.</p></p>
