<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy-Duty Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Positive-Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heavy-duty pumps are used in industries requiring high-pressure and flow rate applications. Centrifugal pumps are ideal for transferring liquids quickly and efficiently due to their fast rotating impeller design. Positive displacement pumps, on the other hand, provide a consistent flow rate by trapping and pushing liquid through a fixed volume chamber. Both types offer unique benefits for different applications, with centrifugal pumps being more suitable for high-flow applications and positive displacement pumps being better for high-pressure and viscous fluids.</p></p>
