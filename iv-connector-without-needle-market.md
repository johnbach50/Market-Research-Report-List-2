<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IV Connector Without Needle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Fluid Displacement</li><li>Negative Fluid Displacement</li><li>Neutral Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>IV connectors without needle come in three main types - Positive Fluid Displacement, Negative Fluid Displacement, and Neutral Displacement. In Positive Fluid Displacement connectors, fluid is pushed out of the device when disconnected, reducing the risk of air entering the system. Negative Fluid Displacement connectors prevent air from entering the system by creating a vacuum upon disconnection. Neutral Displacement connectors maintain equal pressure inside and outside the device, minimizing the risk of air embolisms. Each type offers unique benefits for different clinical settings and patient needs.</p></p>
