<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extruded Geogrids Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uniaxial Geogrids</li><li>Biaxial Geogrids</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extruded geogrids are commonly classified into two main types: uniaxial geogrids and biaxial geogrids. Uniaxial geogrids are used primarily for applications where reinforcement in one direction is required, such as in slope stabilization or embankment reinforcement. Biaxial geogrids, on the other hand, provide reinforcement in both directions, making them suitable for applications like pavement construction and soil stabilization. Both types of geogrids offer improved load distribution, reduced rutting, and increased durability in civil engineering projects.</p></p>
