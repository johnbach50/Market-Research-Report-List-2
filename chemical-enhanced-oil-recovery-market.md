<p><strong>The Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer</li><li>Surfactant</li><li>ASP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) involves the use of different types of chemicals to improve the extraction of oil from reservoirs. Polymer flooding involves injecting polymers into the reservoir to improve the sweep efficiency and increase oil recovery. Surfactant flooding utilizes surfactants to reduce interfacial tension and improve the displacement of oil. Alkaline Surfactant Polymer (ASP) flooding is a combination of all three chemicals to maximize oil recovery. Each method has its own advantages and applications depending on the characteristics of the reservoir.</p></p>
