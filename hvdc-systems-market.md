<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HVDC Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Point-to-Point Transmission</li><li>Back-to-Back Station</li><li>Multi-Terminal System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HVDC systems have three main market types: point-to-point transmission, back-to-back station, and multi-terminal systems. Point-to-point transmission involves power being sent from a single converter station to another, usually across long distances. Back-to-back stations are used to connect two asynchronous AC systems by converting AC to DC and then back to AC. Multi-terminal systems involve connecting multiple converter stations to a central point, allowing for more flexible power flow control and improved system reliability.</p></p>
