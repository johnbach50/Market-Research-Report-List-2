<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infant Oxygen Masks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Operation Window</li><li>No Operation Window</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infant oxygen masks with operation window are designed with a transparent window that allows medical professionals to easily monitor the baby's oxygen levels and adjust as needed without interrupting treatment. On the other hand, infant oxygen masks without an operation window do not have this feature, making it more difficult for healthcare providers to observe the baby's oxygen levels during treatment. Both types of masks serve the same purpose of delivering oxygen to infants in need, but the presence of an operation window provides added convenience and efficiency for medical staff.</p></p>
